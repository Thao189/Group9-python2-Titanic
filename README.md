Hi!✨ A warm welcome to all!!
We are students in the B-IT class - Group 9👨🏻‍💻. Together, we have embarked on our journey of building this project for Python 2. 
Inspired by a true event, the Titanic🚢 - a supposedly unsinkable ship that tragically sank, causing numerous casualties. This event has captivated the public due to its profound tragedy. This inspired the data set we chose which includes detailed information about a subset of the 891 passengers on board and provides survival rates, also known as "ground truth."
This data set is provided by Kaggle.com, the link will be placed below for you to refer to:

App introduces:

+) About our app🎯: This app will provide not only a brief but also a comprehensive summary of the Titanic's survival statistics for readers. In addition, the data also offers an overview of the size, distribution, and demographics of the passengers on the Titanic

+) Our app includes 3 parts:
The Data Explorer :
-> This will be the key 🔑 for those who want to unlock a deeper understanding of our dataset, from its features to the underlying meanings of each component.

The Feature Distribution📊:
-> The core part of this app, with a variety of charts, is applied in order to visualize our analysis. With the aim of helping people through these charts understand more about the distribution based on different features of the Titanic.

Survive Titanic Quizzes🌊:
-> Although this is just a "supporting character" in this project, we are fully committed to creating captivating content for everyone to enjoy in this application. Are you interested in knowing what your survival rate would be if you were on the Titanic? If so, you're in luck! In this section, we utilize the dataset we've gathered from Kaggle to compute your own survival rate based on the information you provide. This feature, which transforms users into characters, is something we take great pride in.
